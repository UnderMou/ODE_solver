# ODE_solver
This package is designed to solve Ordinary Differential Equaitons (ODE) numerically in C++ with post processing in python. 

To do list:
Enhance Python post processing application.
Enhance Method::time_step_advance() function. IDEA: Let user pass string with solver name. Add more solvers (Runge-Kutta, etc.)
