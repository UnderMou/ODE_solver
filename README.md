# ODE_solver
This package is designed to solve Ordinary Differential Equaitons (ODE) numerically in C++ with post processing in python. 

To do list:
Develop Problem class as an abstract class and the user must setup an "instatiable" class particular to his/her problem
Develop Method::time_step_advance() function. IDEA: Let user pass string with solver name.
